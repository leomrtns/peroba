## Introduction
**peroba** is a tool for continuous updating of outbreak information as new sequences are
incorporated. 
It is been developed as a phylogenetic tracking tool to aggregate samples sequenced at the QIB 
with global information from [COG-UK](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/) and [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/). 
Therefore you will not find any data here, although [all COG-UK data are available
online](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/).

**peroba** is the name of a Brazilian timber tree, but if you like acronyms it stands 
for Phylogenetic Epidemiology with ROBust Assignment.
